When writing code, version control is essential for saving progress and retaining a history of updates. In this class we will be using GitHub for uploading homeworks and other assignments for submission. As you may already know, this course has a GitHub page for hosting class materials (https://github.com/CoAxLab/BiologicallyIntelligentExploration).\n","\n","**Colab** (formally \"Google Colaboratoy\") is a website for writing and running code in a convenient, interactive, and visually-useful fashion. Specifically, the format of code used on Colab is a \"Jupyter Notebook\" (see more info [here](https://jupyter.org) if you are interested). This lab is actually built as a Jupyter notebook. You can run Jupyter notebooks on your own machine if you like, but for ease, we will be using Colab to run and write code in this class.\n","\n","In this class you will need to set up a Github repository for keeping track of your labs. It will also help to connect it with Google Golab (your Andrew account should give you access to both).\n","\n","To do this, just follow the steps below."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# How to submit your completed lab notebooks"],"metadata":{"id":"nMXAEARAgwXO"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"0iwTqNZfwNg6"},"source":["---\n","### **Step 1: Set up a GitHub repository**\n","\n","* Create a [GitHub](https://github.com) account if you do not have one.
