    "\n",
    "In lab 2 we played with a random search agent that wandered using Brownian motion. Here we will introuce a new random agent that moves according to Levy walks. \n",
    "\n",
    "* A Levy walk is is a continuing process of random movement where at each \"step\" of movement, a direction of and distance of movement is chosen randomly. The distance $\\delta_i$ of movement at each time step $i$ is sampled from the random distribution as follows: $\\delta_i = {u_i}^{-\\frac{1}{\\gamma}}$, where $u_i \\sim N(\\mu,\\sigma)$ and $\\gamma > 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our _chemotaxis_ agent (_AccumulatorGradientDiscrete_) tries to directly estimate the gradient of the scent $\\nabla$  by comparing the level of scent at the last grid position it occupied to the current scent level ($o$). By last position here we mean the last position when it moved last. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\nabla \\approx o_t - o_{t-1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Our chemotaxis agent thus behaves as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When the scent gradient is positive, meaning you are going \"up\" the gradient, the probability of turning is set to _p pos_. \n",
    "- When the gradient is negative, the turning probability is set to _p neg_. (See code below, for an example). \n",
    "- If the agent \"decides\" to turn, the direction is uniform random.\n",
    "- The length of travel before the next turn decision is sampled from an exponential distribution just like the _DiffusionDiscrete_"
