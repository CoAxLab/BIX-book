We typically write this as $N(0,1)$.\n","\n","2. *The signal distribution.* This will always have the same variance as the noise distribution, but with a different mean. The mean of the signal distribution is called *d-prime* (or $d'$) and by convention we represent it as a positive number. The $d'$ reflects the signal-to-noise ratio.\n","\n","3. *Threshold.* This is also referred to as the strategy of the observer/agent and is sometimes referenced just as $C$.\n","\n","4. *Ideal observer threshold.* This is the _statistically optimal_ separation between the noise and signal distributions. Because they have the same standard deviations, the ideal observer is just $\\frac{d'}{2}$.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"ECmiRzWODsSW"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Outcomes**\n","\n","An experiment to test the signal characteristics in biological systems typically involves presenting signals of different intensities in the context of background noise and having an agent make a response when a stimulus appears above their detection threshold. Often this detection is implicit and depends on the sensory systems of the agent.\n","\n","By looking at the relationship between stimulus (signal present vs. signal absent) and responses (response made or not), we can estimate 4 different classes of outcomes based on the agent's responses.\n","\n","1. *Hits.* When a signal was presented and a response was registered.\n","\n","2. *Misses.* When a signal was presented and no response was registered.\n","\n","3. *False alarms.* When no signal was presented and a response was registered.\n","\n","4. *Correct rejections.* When no signal was presented and no response was registered.\n","\n","From these we can directly estimate the signal-to-noise intensity for any agent by calculating the $d'$ behaviorally as:\n","\n","$$ d' = \\Phi(hits) - \\Phi(false\\ alarms)$$\n","\n","Here $\\Phi(\\cdot)$ means that we have converted the rates to a $z-score$. Basically we treat the rates, bounded between $0$ and $1$, as the p-values of a standard normal distribution and use a lookup table to determine what z-score (i.e., standard deviations away from the mean) would produce that p-value.
