    "In lab 1 we played with a random search agent that wandered using Brownian motion. Here we will introuce a new random agent that moves according to Levy walks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A Levy walk is a continuing process of random movement where at each \"step\" of movement, a direction of and distance of movement is chosen randomly. The distance $\\delta_i$ of movement at each time step $i$ is sampled from the random distribution as follows: $\\delta_i = {u_i}^{-\\frac{1}{\\gamma}}$, where $u_i \\sim N(\\mu,\\sigma)$ and $\\gamma > 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our _chemotaxis_ agent (_GradientDiffusionGrid_) tries to directly estimate the gradient of the scent $\\nabla S$  by comparing the level of scent at the last grid position it occupied to the current scent level ($s$). By last position here we mean the last position when it moved last.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\nabla S \\approx s_t - s_{t-1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Our chemotaxis agent thus behaves as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When the gradient is positive, meaning you are going \"up\" the gradient, the probability of turning and sampling from a Levy walk power law (i.e., a jump) is set to _p pos_.\n",
    "- When the gradient is negative, the probability of a jump is set to _p neg_. (See code below, for an example).\n",
    "- If the agent \"decides\" to jump, the direction it takes is uniform random.\n",
    "- The length of travel now is just a single step on the grid. This makes our decision problem a lot simpler. Basically this is equivalent to making the diffusion parameter, $D$, consistent across experiments.\n"
